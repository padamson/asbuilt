# The monitor runs on a schedule nobody watches, so a classifier that calls
# a hit "broken" fails one job and files nothing, and one that calls a

# from a scratch repo with a root and two nested lockfiles, so the tree
# list is tested as well. The renderer cases pin when watchers get a
# comment, and that the body always fits on GitHub.
